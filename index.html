<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Nicolas Delgado and I am 19 years old. I grew up in Cicero while attending Saint Francis Of Rome before moving to Berwyn.</p>
<p>In Berwyn, I then attended Fenwick High School where soon after, I have now moved into Lewis University as a resident of Sheil Hall.</p>
<p>My parents are named Arturo and Hannah and I love them both very much. My dad is Mexican while my mom is white which makes me a mix of the two.</p>

<h2>Why Computer Science?</h2>
<p>I have always been interested in Video Games when I was a kid. After school, I would go home and hop on the game with my friends for hours and hours.</P>
<p>Now that I have grown up, I occasionally play games with my friends but I have a goal now which relates to my experiences.</p>
<p>I want to be able to help create games in order for people around the world to feel the same satisfaction and enjoyment I felt when I was younger.</p>

<h2>My Favorite Music</h2>
<p>As stated later in the text, I absolutely love listening to music! I listen to many genres besides country. </p>
<p>Below is just one of my playlists that I am very fond of.</p>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/5PMkLQVStiMurxHZfCggX8?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="100%" height="380" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

<h2>What I Hope To Learn In This Class</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Know what how to code efficiently and profficiently</li>
<li>The basics of each major coding language</li>
<li>How to read and understand what each line of code means</li>
</ul>


<h2>My Favorite Hobby/Activity</h2>
<p>Some of my favorite hobbies include working out, listening to music(I absolutely love music), playing games with my friends,</p>
<p>hanging out with my friends, and finally going on runs to clear my mind.</p>

<h2>Fun Fact About Me</h2>
<p>A fun fact about myself would definetly be that I one of the tallest one in my dad's side of the family. I am 6'1 while my dad is 5'9 and my mom is 5'6.</p>
<p>The only person who I would say beats me would be my uncle as he is basically the same height as me.</p>
<p>On my mom's side though it is a different story. The tallest on that side would be my uncle Ted who stands at a nice 6'5 which is crazy to me as everyone else is pretty short but him.</p>
